● First create one component and one service which should make one api call
using http client, then  
    ○  Write test case using MockBackend, MockConnection  
    ○  Make one method which will return expecting object(service data format)
using observable.  
● Now test:  
    ○ Length of object.

<u><b>Notes:
1. Angular CLI was used and so use `ng serve` and run app on `localhost:4200`
    and `ng test` for running unit tests
2. Referred to `http://www.thejoemorgan.com/blog/2016/11/21/testing-apis-in-angular-2/`
